# tg-message-beautifier

The tg-message-beautifier is a simple script that beautifies messages by adding a start and end tag to the text. It uses the Telethon library to interact with the Telegram API.

## Prerequisites

Before running the bot, make sure you have the following:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- `telethon` library installed. You can install it using `pip`:

  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Obtain your `api_id` and `api_hash` from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org). Replace the empty strings in `config.py` with your actual `api_id` and `api_hash`.

3. If you are using userbot, set `userbot` to `True` in `config.py`.

4. Set the `message` variable to what you would like to see in your message.

---

If `userbot` is set to `True` in the configuration, any message starting with a dot (.) will be ignored by the bot.

## How to Use

1. Run the `main.py` script:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

2. The bot will now be running and listening for new messages.
